The Finance Department  of  Fortune Business Systems Ltd has sought your help in developing a program that captures an employeeâ€™s details: employee ID, first name, second name, surname, gender, Date of Birth (entered in dd-mm-yyyy format) and monthly basic salary

Create a class called employee that captures the above data using the class constructor. The class should also have a function show_employee(), which should display employee information.
Implement the class using an employee object called emp_obj. 
 
Employees of Fortune Business Systems Ltd contribute 5% of their monthly basic salary towards their individual pension savings. Since this may change in future, the operation to compute the pension has not been included. A friend function (to the class employee) called compute_pension() to calculate and return the pension contribution of an employee is therefore needed. In addition to the output above.
